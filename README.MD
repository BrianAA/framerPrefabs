## How can I help?
The things we need the most help for the library and its community are:

**🐛 Bug reports:** We simply can’t catch them all. Check existing issues and discussion first, then create a new issue to let us know what needs to be squashed!

🎬 **Create tutorials**. Send them to us and we’ll happily share them! We have a [youtube channel here ](https://youtube.com/@FramerPrefabs?si=nyofZ_Cal6dOPgQw) and even add your channel for cross reference and support.

## Edit our [Docs](www.framerprefabs.com)
Our docs are on framer. We sadly cannot open them up directly to folks or we would have to pay for everyone to be an editor. However you can open a issue on github and suggestion a fix or improvement.
